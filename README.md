# Social App

This is a basic application that demonstrates how an iOS app might interact with **Firebase** to display a stream of content.

It features a minimal set of requirements that allow the following:

- Sign up, sign in and Sign out
- Users are able to create posts and delete posts *they own*
- View them on a time line
- Minimal and attractive UI

Social also includes a minimal set of frameworks, one of which I have developed called *[GyozaKit](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GyozaKit)* used for displaying messages to the user in an unobtrusive way.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/john-crossley/social.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/john-crossley/social)

This is a basic application that demonstrates how an iOS app might interact with **Firebase** to display a stream of content.

It features a minimal set of requirements that allow the following:

- Sign up, sign in and Sign out
- Users are able to create posts and delete posts *they own*
- View them on a time line
- Minimal and attractive UI
